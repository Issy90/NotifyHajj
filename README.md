# NotifyHajj
Project for the hajj hackathon

## Inspiration

We did a research about the issues that pilgrims face during hajj and we also heard some stories from previous pilgrims about the difficulties that they faced during hajj we found out that communication is one of the biggest issues so, we decided to encounter this issue and find a suitable solution for it. 

## What it does

An application that will notify the pilgrims of important events such as traffic, lost items, weather updates, transportation, campaigns, general information. It will be like a instant broadcast service that will help pilgrims throughout their stay during hajj. 

## How we built it
We are building the application with Android studio

## Challenges we ran into
Right now we are facing a challenge of sending push notifications based on the users location

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
